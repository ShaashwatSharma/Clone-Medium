# Medium Clone Web Application

A clone of the popular blogging platform, Medium, built with modern web technologies. This project replicates the core functionality of Medium, allowing users to read, write, and publish articles.

## Features

-   **User Authentication** :  Sign up, log in, and manage user accounts using Tokens .
-   **Create and Edit Articles** :  Write, edit, and format blog posts using editor.
-   **Article Feed** :  View a list of articles posted by Others.
-   **Responsive Design** :  Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.


## Tech Stack

-   **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for creating the dynamic and responsive frontend of the application.
-   **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, improving code quality, catching errors early, and enhancing the development experience.
-   **React Router DOM**: A library that handles routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different pages and components without refreshing the browser.
-   **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js used to create the backend server, handling routes, API requests, and responses.
-   **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for storing structured data like user accounts, articles, and interactions.
-   **Prisma**: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) used to interact with the PostgreSQL database, making it easy to define and manage database schemas and perform efficient queries.
-   **Prisma Accelerate**: Enhances Prisma performance for production applications by speeding up query execution.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with pre-defined styles for responsiveness, layout, and component styling.
-   **Cloudflare Workers**: A serverless platform for running backend logic closer to the users, enabling faster performance and reducing latency by serving the application at the edge.
-   **Hono**: A small, fast web framework for Cloudflare Workers, used for handling HTTP requests and building serverless APIs.
-   **Zod Validation**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, used to ensure that incoming data (e.g., form submissions or API requests) adheres to expected formats.
-   **Prisma ORM**: Used for database interaction, enabling easy access and manipulation of PostgreSQL with TypeScript and automatic schema synchronization.

## This stack focuses on full-stack development with TypeScript for both backend and frontend, fast deployment with Cloudflare Workers, and efficient database management with Prisma ORM.
